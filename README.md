> **"Bridging the epistemic gap between Global South realities and global AI governance frameworks."**
## 📖 About This Repository
This repository documents my ongoing research into the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Legal Frameworks, and Peace Innovation**. It serves as a living archive of my methodology, theoretical frameworks, and working papers as an Erasmus Mundus Master’s candidate and Visiting Professor at the University for Peace (UPEACE).

**Primary Research Question:** How can we construct AI governance frameworks that respect **technodiversity** and **indigenous data sovereignty** while interacting effectively with major regulatory regimes like the EU AI Act?

## ⚖️ Methodological Principles
To ensure rigor and transparency, this research adheres to the following principles:

1.  **Transparency in Uncertainty:** Explicitly stating known unknowns, particularly regarding data gaps in Global South contexts.
2.  **Policy Relevance:** Every theoretical framework includes a "Policy Translation" section mapping concepts to actionable regulatory levers.
3.  **Centered, Not Cited:** Global South perspectives are treated as central theoretical lenses, not merely as case studies for Western frameworks.
4.  **Reproducibility:** Commitment to Open Science principles where data privacy permits.
