# Literature Review — Algorithmic Profiling and Dark Patterns

## Purpose
Summary of legal, technical, and behavioral scholarship on profiling, nudging, and manipulation under EU law.

## Key regulatory sources
- EDPB Guidelines 3/2019 on processing of personal data through video devices — for profiling transparency and proportionality.
- EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent — tests for freely given and dark patterns in consent flows.
- CNIL, Deliberation SAN-2022-013 (Google/YouTube cookies) — enforcement posture on asymmetric friction and refusal options.
- AEPD, PS/00477/2019 (La Liga app) — device mic access and consent scope.

## Academic references
- Mathur et al. (2019), "Dark Patterns at Scale" — taxonomy with empirical prevalence; highlights confirmshaming and obstruction.
- Narayanan et al. (2020), "Dark Patterns: Past, Present, and Future" — research agenda and links to manipulation.
- Susser, Roessler, Nissenbaum (2019), "Online Manipulation: Hidden Influences in a Digital World" — ethical framing; distinguishes persuasion vs manipulation.

## Behavioral insights
- Friction symmetry: refusal vs acceptance cost as a measurable proxy for coercion.
- Timing of consent prompts: interruptive vs contextual placement impacts autonomy.
- Personalization intensity: measuring shift from recommendation to steering.

## Gaps to address
- Metrics to operationalize "freely given" under friction asymmetry.
- AI Act interaction: how transparency obligations layer on GDPR Art. 22 safeguards.
- Sectoral nuances: adtech vs credit scoring vs employment platforms.

## Next steps
- Extract enforcement fact patterns into structured variables (friction, information symmetry, redress).
- Map patterns to GDPR articles and AI Act risk categories.
- Build comparison table across CNIL, AEPD, DPC, ICO cases.
