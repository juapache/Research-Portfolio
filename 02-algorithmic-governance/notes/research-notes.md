# Research Notes — Algorithmic Governance

## Open questions
- Where does nudging become manipulation under EU consent standards when friction is asymmetric?
- How should lawful bases be evaluated when profiling mixes contract, consent, and legitimate interest claims in one flow?
- What explanations satisfy GDPR Art. 13/14/22 for behavioral models without exposing trade secrets?

## Working hypotheses
- Friction asymmetry and interface obstruction are strong indicators of invalid consent, regardless of banner text clarity.
- Layered notices can comply if refusal is one click and equal prominence; multi-click refusal likely fails.
- AI Act transparency duties may force more granular model cards for high-risk profiling contexts.

## Evidence to gather
- DPA decisions on cookie banners and consent management platforms (CMPs).
- Adtech platform UI captures showing acceptance vs refusal steps.
- Model documentation from credit scoring and employment screening vendors.

## Immediate tasks
- Pull 3–5 recent DPA cases (CNIL, AEPD, DPC) for friction analysis.
- Draft comparison table: practice → legal hook (GDPR articles/recitals) → risk factors → potential AI Act obligations.
- Identify one Spanish case for localized discussion.
