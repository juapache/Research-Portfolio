# CNIL vs Google/YouTube Cookie Consent (SAN-2022-013)

**Date:** January 6, 2022 (decision published)
**Jurisdiction:** France (CNIL)
**Sector:** Adtech / Video platform
**Legal Issue:** Cookie consent dark patterns; refusal friction; invalid consent under GDPR + ePrivacy

## Facts
- Google domains presented cookie banners where refusal required multiple clicks across nested screens, while acceptance was single-click.
- Users faced asymmetry in friction and visibility; refusal path hidden behind "Customize" flow.
- CNIL asserted joint application of GDPR (controller obligations) and ePrivacy (terminal equipment access).

## Legal Analysis
- Consent not "freely given" (GDPR Art. 4(11), 7) due to friction asymmetry and interface obstruction.
- Transparency shortcomings: absence of clear refusal option on first layer contravened informed consent requirements.
- ePrivacy breach: storing/reading cookies without valid consent.

## Outcome
- Fine: €150 million (Google LLC + Google Ireland Limited).
- Injunction: provide a one-click refusal option and improve banner clarity within 3 months; daily penalties for non-compliance.

## Policy Implications
- Establishes enforcement benchmark that refusal friction invalidates consent even when information is present.
- Signals EU regulators expect symmetry between accept and refuse controls on first-layer banners.
- Suggests CMPs should expose balanced primary buttons and limit nesting of refusal flows.
